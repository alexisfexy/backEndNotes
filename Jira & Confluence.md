## Agile Prinicples:

- iterative development 
- adaptive to changing requirements
- frequent delivery
- close collab btwn cross-functional teams
- SCRUM + Kanban methodologies



**SCRUM:**

- Break projects into Epics & User Stories
  - Epic: larger body of work, broken into stories
  - User Story: smallest unit of work
    - as a <type of user> i want <some goal> so that <some reason>
- User Stories prioritized 
- Development is performed in short cycles, known as *Sprints*



Example: 

- story: a feature to be develoiped

- this section of the lesson is an epic and each little lecture is a story

Backlog: all the features you want to build in the form of user stories (in ready state, all details laid out)

Sprint backlog: group of features you are working on in this period of time 

Scrum: daily meeting to discuss progress of spring 



Sprint Planning:

- sprint backlog made from product backlog
- dev team provides estimates - story points or hours 
  - story point = estimates are made relative to the smallest component with a known level of difficulty
  - number story points / sprint = team velocity  

Daily Scrum: (15 minutes)

- what i did yesterday
- what i plan to do today
- do i have have blockers 

Sprint Review & Retrospective:

- review: what is complete / not 
- retrospective: what went well / what didnt
